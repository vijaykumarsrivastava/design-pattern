# Builder Pattern

#### Definition

The Builder pattern can be used to ease the construction of a complex object
from simple objects. The Builder pattern also separates the construction of a
complex object from its representation so that the same construction process
can be used to create another composition of objects.
Related patterns include Abstract Factory and Composite.

#### Where to use

* When the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of
the parts that make up the object and how they are assembled.
* When the construction process must allow different representations for the
object that is constructed.
* When you want to insulate clients from the knowledge of the actual
creation process and/or resulting product.

#### Benefits

* The built object is shielded from the details of its construction.
* Code for construction is isolated from code for representation and both are
easy to replace without affecting the other.
* Gives you control over the construction process.
* Gives you the possibility to reuse and/or change the process and/or product
independently.

#### Drawbacks/consequences

Need flexibility in creating various complex objects. Need to create complex,
aggregate objects.
